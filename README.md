# bam-sample
`bam-sample` is a simple Python CLI tool for drawing random alleles from a given BAM file.
It generates output in a VCF format, as a simple tab-separated table or simply writes its
output to `stdout`.

It provides a set of options for processing ancient DNA data, such as filtering out
potential false SNPs caused by DNA damage, etc.
